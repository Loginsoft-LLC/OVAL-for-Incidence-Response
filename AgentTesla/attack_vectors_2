As you can see, it asks the victim to double click the blue icon to enable a “clear view.” Once clicked, it extracts an exe file from the embedded object into the system’s temporary folder and runs it.  In this case, the exe file is called “POM.exe”

In figure 3 we can see that the malware is written in the MS Visual Basic language. Based on my analysis, it’s a kind of installer program. When it runs, it drops two files: “filename.exe” and “filename.vbs” into the “%temp%\subfolder”. It then exits the process after executing the file “filename.vbs”.  Below, in figure 4, is the content of “filename.vbs”.

HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\Registry Key Name

keyName: "Registry Key Name"
valueName: "C:\User\...\AppData\Local\Temp\subfolder\filename.vbs"
keyType: "REG_SZ"

To make it run automatically when the system starts, it adds itself (runs filename.vbs) to the system registry as a startup program. It then runs “%temp%\filename.exe”.
