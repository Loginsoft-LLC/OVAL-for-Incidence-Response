1. Implementing Watering Hole Attack on compromised website used by emplooyes.
2. Attacking with XSS to inject malicious javascript file and gather information.
3. Gathered information contains profile of victim's browser with 50 datapoints, they are: victimâ€™s language, timezone, screen information, device type, browser plugins, referrer, device memory, cookie functionality, and more.
4. Its collected to select only targeted victims. It is checked with exploit server.
5. It sets an encrypted AES-256-CBC channel on top of TLS with RSA-2048 key to exchange zero-day exploit.
6. In this exploit they used signed kernel driver(HW.sys) through BYOVD fashion and loaded it from C:\Windows\System32\drivers\HW.sys.
7. This driver has already some zero-day exploits.
8. It is exploited through Input output controller(IOCTL). 0x9C40648C can be abused for reading physical memory and 0x9C40A4CC for writing physical memory(Mitigation for this can be blocklisting the driver).
