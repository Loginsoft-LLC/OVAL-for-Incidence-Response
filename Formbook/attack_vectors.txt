Installation

The FormBook malware copies itself to a new location. The malware first chooses one of the following strings to use as a prefix for its installed filename:

ms, win, gdi, mfc, vga, igfx, user, help, config, update, regsvc, chkdsk, systray, audiodg, certmgr, autochk, taskhost, colorcpl, services, IconCache, ThumbCache, Cookies

It then generates two to five random characters and appends those to the chosen string above 

followed by one of the following file extensions:

    .exe, .com, .scr, .pif, .cmd, .bat

If the malware is running with elevated privileges, it copies itself to one of the following directories:

    %ProgramFiles% 
    %CommonProgramFiles%

If running with normal privileges, it copies itself to one of the following directories:

    %USERPROFILE%
    %APPDATA%
    %TEMP%

Persistence

The malware uses the same aforementioned string list with a random string to create a prefix, appends one to five random characters, and uses this value as the registry value name.

The malware configures persistence to one of the following two locations depending on its privileges:

    (HKCU|HKLM)\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
    (HKCU|HKLM)\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run
